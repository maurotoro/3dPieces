Scad scripts and STL for the pieces that I have made

Hopefully I'll be able to keep everything organized, on the openSCAD folder the scripts with helpfull names 
and STL folder with the pieces to slice.

I may add other folders with configurations and such, but on the mean time, I'll just keep track of my stuff online.

If you want to use this, please be carefull, it may not work or worst....
